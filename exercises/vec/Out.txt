definition of the vectors for testing:
a = (1, 2, 3)
b = (-1, 0, 1)
c = (0.5, 3.14, 1)

Test of simple operations:
2*a = (2, 4, 6)
a+c = (1.5, 5.14, 4)
c-b = (1.5, 3.14, 0)
b-c = (-1.5, -3.14, 0)
-a-b = (0, -2, -4)

Test of dot products(using x.dot(y) ):
a . b = 2
b . a = 2
a . a = 14
a . d = 0

Test of dot products(using x.dot(y) ):
a . b = 2
b . a = 2
a . a = 14
a . d = 0
